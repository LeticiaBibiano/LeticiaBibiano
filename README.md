Hello, I'm Leticia, and I'm thrilled to take you through my journey ðŸ‘‹

Since May 2021, I've been immersed in the world of programming, initially guiding children in crafting games with JavaScript. Today, I extend my expertise to both young minds and adults, empowering them with coding skills. You can find me on YouTube and across social media platforms under the handle @debugadora. Teaching is not just a profession for me; it's my passion!

Moreover, since September 2021, I've been working as a programmer for various enterprises, delving deep into the Ruby ecosystem and microservices. My affection for coding extends to JavaScript as well; it's where my heart lies!

I'm not bound to any single technology; rather, I believe in the adaptability to any language. What truly matters to me is fostering a robust understanding of algorithms and programming logic, enabling one to navigate through any coding language effortlessly. This philosophy is the cornerstone of my free algorithm and programming logic course on YouTube ;)

This overview only scratches the surface of my journey thus far. I'm continuously evolving my skills and eagerly sharing my knowledge.

I hope you find my profile engaging, and if you're interested, don't hesitate to connect with me through social media or email.
